## Objective

- I wanted to create a portfolio site that reflected my design asthetic - clean, uncluttered, minialistic... introducing me to the user without bombarded them with distracting animations, as well as including plenty of space to make sure the elements "breathed."<br><br>
- Designing and coding an accessibile site was a priority. One of my missions is to make sure more websites are inclusive to ***all*** users.<br><br>
- The site was coded mobile-first, with a responsive flexbox navigation bar for mobile and tablet views. It also includes a dark theme toggle, using prefers-dark-theme and JavaScript to allow the user to toggle light/dark themes no matter their OS setting.
